# Real-Data Analysis

This folder contains the plink and R code used to conduct the real-data analysis on the effects of BMI on smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked, depression and self-harm using ALSPAC data. Access to [ALSPAC](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/) data was obtained as part of application B3838. The data are not provided here due to privacy reasons.

The two .R files contain the code to run the observational and MR analyses on the real data. The .txt files contain information on the genetic variants used as instruments for inference and selection, and file "Extracting Derived Variables.txt" describes how the data for each instrument were extracted from the ALSPAC genetic dataset.
